# Fluidspeed

Fluidspeed is a real-time programmable and streaming payments tool.


## Introduce

Fluidspeed provides developers and end-users the ability to pay and be paid in a more convenient and seamless manner than conventional banking.

## Problem

It is arguable whether payments with cryptocurrency are more convenient and flexible compared with fiat payments. While Fluidspeed can meet a variety of programmable on-chain payment requirements, it is better known for enabling streaming gasless payments. This primitive makes a wide range of potential continuous payment use cases possible, from subscriptions, payroll to rent, and even minor investing.  Not only does Fluidspeed eliminate non-payment risk, it dramatically increases access to cash flow for the payment recipient, and provides increased flexibility to the payer.


## How it work?

The tool leverages a protocol in which a smart contract agreement is opened once in order to continuously stream a payment from your wallet to the wallet of your counterparty. Essentially, instead of paying for a subscription or salary on a periodic basis, you would pay for it on a continuous basis; every second, some predefined value will be transmitted in real-time in an ongoing gasless transaction.
