# Fluidspeed

Fluidspeed is a real-time programmable and streaming payments tool.


## Introduce

Fluidspeed provides developers and end-users the ability to pay and be paid in a more convenient and seamless manner than conventional banking.

## Problem

It is arguable whether payments with cryptocurrency are more convenient and flexible compared with fiat payments. While Fluidspeed can meet a variety of programmable on-chain payment requirements, it is better known for enabling streaming gasless payments. This primitive makes a wide range of potential continuous payment use cases possible, from subscriptions, payroll to rent, and even minor investing.  Not only does Fluidspeed eliminate non-payment risk, it dramatically increases access to cash flow for the payment recipient, and provides increased flexibility to the payer.


## How it work?

The tool leverages a protocol in which a smart contract agreement is opened once in order to continuously stream a payment from your wallet to the wallet of your counterparty. Essentially, instead of paying for a subscription or salary on a periodic basis, you would pay for it on a continuous basis; every second, some predefined value will be transmitted in real-time in an ongoing gasless transaction.

Core features of the platform include:

1. Gasless transfers: once you open the payment streams, value is transferred every second without the need to make additional transactions.
2. No capital lockups: users only need to add capital to their balance in a just-in-time fashion; essentially the smart contract payment will stream until the balance runs out of funds; in order to keep the stream open, you only need to add funds before the balance runs out. 
3. On the Ethereum mainchain: powers full composability for development applications and removes obstacles when withdrawing paid funds like those faced in using Layer 2 scaling solutions or non-Ethereum cryptocurrencies. For example, if the Fluidspeed protocol used non-ERC-20 tokens, withdrawing funds would require an additional token swap. Or if the protocol used a Layer 2 solution, it would require an additional step of settling on the main chain. Because everything happens on Layer 1 via smart contracts, users avoid additional steps that add to time spent transacting.
