# Fluidspeed

Fluidspeed is a real-time programmable and streaming payments tool.


## Introduce

Fluidspeed provides developers and end-users the ability to pay and be paid in a more convenient and seamless manner than conventional banking.

## Problem

It is arguable whether payments with cryptocurrency are more convenient and flexible compared with fiat payments. While Fluidspeed can meet a variety of programmable on-chain payment requirements, it is better known for enabling streaming gasless payments. This primitive makes a wide range of potential continuous payment use cases possible, from subscriptions, payroll to rent, and even minor investing.  Not only does Fluidspeed eliminate non-payment risk, it dramatically increases access to cash flow for the payment recipient, and provides increased flexibility to the payer.
